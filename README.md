# Condor-FPL-Analysis
This script reads condor .fpl files located in the fplFiles folder and creates a fplAnalysis.csv file with the results.  Use this to compare many fpls for similarity or differences at the same time without having to open Condor and load them individually.  

A few fpl files are provided for reference.
